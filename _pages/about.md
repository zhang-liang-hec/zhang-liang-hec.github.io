I am an Associate Research Fellow at HEC Paris, France, working with <a href="https://www.hec.edu/en/faculty-research/faculty-directory/faculty-member/LI-Xitong"> Prof. Xitong Li </a>. I also worked closely with <a href="https://foster.uw.edu/faculty-research/directory/yong-tan/"> Prof. Yong Tan </a> from University of Washington and <a href="https://semen.buaa.edu.cn/Faculty/Information_Systems/WU_Junjie/Profile.htm"> Prof. Junjie Wu </a> from Beihang University. I received my Ph.D degree in Computer Science from NTU, Singapore, supervised by <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/c.long/"> Prof. Cheng Long </a>.  I received my Master's degree in Information System from Beihang University. 

My primary research interests are in the data mining, graph neural network, large language model, and applied AI (with a focus on developing effective ML methods to solve practical business and society problems). My primary research methods include deep learning, field and laboratory experiments.

I am always open to research collaborations. Please feel free to drop me an email if you are interested.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Papers Under Review
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files
